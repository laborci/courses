# Hypotheses and the decision log

## Objectives

Students will be able to formulate testable design hypotheses from research or test findings. They will understand why decisions should not be explained from memory and record the evidence, change, expected impact, and remaining uncertainty in a decision log.

## From finding to hypothesis

> [!note] Key idea
> A test finding does not automatically tell us what to build. If participants do not notice a cancellation condition, several causes are possible: it appears too late, the label is poor, the text is too long, or users do not expect it at that point. Before making an improvement, state your proposed explanation and the effect you expect from the change.

A useful form is: **If [change], then [user behavior or understanding] will improve because [assumed cause].** For example: “If we show a short summary of the cancellation condition beside appointment selection, participants will be able to explain the rule correctly before payment because the information needed for the decision will be visible at the moment of choice.” This does not guarantee success, but it provides a testable claim.

## What is a decision log for?

During a project, it is easy to lose track of why an element moved, why a feature was dropped, or which evidence supported a choice between two solutions. A decision log treats this as a learning opportunity rather than administration. Each entry should include the date or iteration, initial evidence, hypothesis, chosen change, rejected alternative, expected impact, and open question.

This also supports the later presentation. Instead of saying “it seemed better this way,” you can show which participant behavior informed the decision, what changed, and what limitation remains. If the new version still fails, the log remains valuable: you avoid repeating the same dead end.

## Evidence and uncertainty

Do not claim more certainty than the research permits. A recurring difficulty among three testers is a strong signal to improve a prototype, but does not prove that every user behaves the same way in the live system. In the log, indicate whether a decision rests on research data, a professional principle, a constraint, or an assumption.

## Worked example

Finding: two participants believed that selecting an appointment automatically booked it. Hypothesis: a clear summary and “Submit booking” action after selection will help participants distinguish selection from finalization. Decision: change the visible status at the top of the screen and the button label. Open question: will the summary remain prominent enough on mobile? The next test can investigate this.

## Common misconceptions

| Statement | Clarification |
| --- | --- |
| “The decision log is needed only at the end.” | Recording close to the decision is more accurate and supports the next iteration too. |
| “A hypothesis means we already know the solution.” | It explicitly states what still needs checking. |

## Review questions

1. Which finding can you turn into a hypothesis today?
2. What evidence supports your strongest decision?
3. Which change still has the most uncertainty behind it?

## Glossary

**Hypothesis:** a testable assumption about a change's expected effect.  
**Decision log:** a document recording the reasons and consequences of design decisions.  
**Iteration:** changing a design based on new evidence.  
**Open question:** uncertainty requiring further investigation.
